%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Parallel methods %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Parallel Methods}
The parallel code takes advantage of the GPU's unique computing capability by
completely restructuring the calculation strategy. Instead of looping through
every particle and tracking it through space, the parallel code assigns a thread
to every voxel in space. Each thread performs a line-box intersection qeuery,
tallying the particle contribution where appropriate. Every thread must check
every particle.

Stuff about how the algorithm works.

The philosophy of this approach is to make the compute time independent of
particle mean free path. Since every thread checks every particle at one point
in space, the compute time is a fixed function of mesh size and the number of
problem particles. Even if the particles traverse a large number of voxels, The
same 6 calculations are performed per particle, per voxel.
