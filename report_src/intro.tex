\section{Introduction}
    Monte Carlo simulation is useful for performing accurate analysis on complex
systems. In the context of nuclear physics, particles are tracked through a
geometry and the collision histories are collected. These track lengths are only useful in
context. Analysts often discretize geometries and apply response functions to
voxels to gain insight about system behavior. CPU codes have traditionally
filled this role. The codes track each particle through a user-defined mesh,
tallying track-length contributions for each voxel the particle passes through.
This is traditionally a slow calculation that impacts time to solution. We have
a attempted an accelerated solution using GPUs.
