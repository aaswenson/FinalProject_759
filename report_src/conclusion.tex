\section{Conclusion}
This work interested us because it is related to our field of 
research. Speeding up tallying on a geometric mesh is important to our work 
as these meshes get very large, and tallying them often takes a long time
using sequential methods. In this project and report we set
forth a new algorithm for parallelized mesh tallying with CUDA. 
From the analysis work, we see that we did not get a speed up compared 
to the sequential code we developed. One possible explanation for this 
behaviour is that the methods used in this project are not optimizing 
the amount of memory used. Using global memory hurt the performance of our code.
forth a new algorithm for parallized mesh tallying with CUDA. 
As shown by our analysis, we did not achieved desired speed ups with our
parallel algorithm. 
A probable explanation for this poor parallel performance is the under-use of
shared memory. Using global memory hurt the performance of our code;
it was an unfortunate impact of the large problems encountered in mesh tallying.
Future work in optimizing/minimizing memory usage on the device may yield
better results.
