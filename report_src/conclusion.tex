\section{Conclusion}
This work is of interest to us because it is related to our field of 
research. Speeding up the tallying on a geometric mesh is of interest 
as these meshes can get very big and can take a long time to tally 
them up with sequential techniques. In this project and report we set
forth a new algorithm for parallization with CUDA. 
From the analysis work, we see that we did not get a speed up compared 
to the sequential code we developed. One possible explanation for this 
behaviour is that the methods used in this project are not optimizing 
the amount of memory used. Namely using global memory might not have 
been the best way to deal with the fact that we write to many spaces 
as we have mesh voxels.
