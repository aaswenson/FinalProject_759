\section{Conclusion}
This work interested us because it is related to our field of 
research. Speeding up tallying on a geometric mesh is important to our work 
as these meshes get very large, and tallying them often takes a long time
using sequential methods. In this project and report we set
forth a new algorithm for parallelized mesh tallying with CUDA. 
As shown by our analysis, we did not achieved desired speed ups with our
parallel algorithm. A probable explanation for this poor parallel performance is the under-use of
shared memory. Using global memory hurt the performance of our code;
it was an unfortunate impact of the large problems encountered in mesh tallying.
Future work in optimizing/minimizing memory usage on the device may yield
better results.
