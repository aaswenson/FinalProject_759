%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Analysis & Benchmark  %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Benchmark Analysis}
In order to quantify the success of our efforts, we performed a scaling analysis 
using python scripts to plot different use cases. The timings of the sequential 
code and the parallel code were the y-parameter of the analysis. 
The x-parameter of the analysis was changed for different scaling analysis.  
The first part of the scaling analysis was done by holding the number of particles, 
the mean free path of the particle, and the volume of the mesh constant while changing 
the number of voxels and the size of the voxels. 


The second part of the analysis was done by using a mesh size with constant measurements 
and changing the mean free path of the particles. 


The third scaling analysis was done using a mesh size with constant parameters and 
changing the number of particles run. Increasig the number of particles increases the 
number of tracks the code has to loop through.
